## Session Log

### Session 1 (COMPLETED ✓)

**Started**: Phase 4 planning and implementation
**Goal**: Test settings.ts and main.ts

#### Tasks Completed
- [x] Created PHASE4-PLAN.md
- [x] Created PHASE4-PROGRESS.md
- [x] Analyzed settings.ts structure
- [x] Created tests/settings.test.ts (60 tests)
- [x] Created tests/main.test.ts (50 tests)
- [x] Wrote DEFAULT_SETTINGS tests
- [x] Wrote validation tests
- [x] Wrote normalization tests
- [x] Fixed 3 test failures (JS type coercion edge cases)
- [x] All 517 tests passing

#### Code Changes
- Created `tests/settings.test.ts` (364 lines, 60 tests)
- Created `tests/main.test.ts` (428 lines, 50 tests)

#### Tests Written
**60 tests for settings.ts:**
- DEFAULT_SETTINGS structure validation (11 tests)
- Boolean field validation (8 tests)
- Numeric field validation (14 tests)
- String enum field validation (16 tests)
- Data integrity checks (4 tests)
- Settings object creation (7 tests)

**50 tests for main.ts:**
- maxCardLength normalization (11 tests)
- maxBubbleLength normalization (9 tests)
- requestTimeoutMs normalization (8 tests)
- Boolean normalization (8 tests)
- Combined normalization (3 tests)
- Bubble color CSS logic (6 tests)
- Settings merge logic (5 tests)

#### Test Results
- Before: 407 tests
- After: 517 tests (+110 tests)
- All 517 tests passing ✓
- Coverage: 39.63% (utilities: 90.84%, services: 73.51%)

#### Issues Fixed
1. **Null value normalization**: `Number(null)` returns 0, gets clamped to minimum
2. **Boolean string coercion**: `Boolean('false')` returns true (non-empty string)
3. **requestTimeoutMs with null**: Gets clamped to 500ms instead of default

#### Next Steps
Documentation updates and final commit

## Resume Instructions

If picking up after token reset:
1. Read PHASE4-PLAN.md for strategy
2. Check this file for current progress
3. Look at "Tasks Completed" above
4. Continue from first unchecked task
5. Run `npm test` to verify current state

**Current Position**: Beginning of Phase 4, planning complete
**Next Task**: Analyze settings.ts structure
