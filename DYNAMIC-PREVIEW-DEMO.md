# Dynamic Preview Mode Demo

## What you should see in Live Preview:

When dynamic preview mode is enabled in settings, bare URLs will show inline preview bubbles with:
- Site favicon (if enabled)
- Page title
- Description (if available and enabled)

The previews appear **after** the URL without modifying the markdown source.

## Test URLs:

Try these bare URLs:

https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/a-postmortem-of-three-recent-issues

https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/

https://github.com/mattmarotta

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics

https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelBook/comments/1nxv8v5/i_am_deeply_embedded_within_the_google_android/

## Comparison with markdown links:

These are already converted to markdown links (dynamic preview won't affect them):

[Anthropic Engineering Blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/a-postmortem-of-three-recent-issues)

[Why Language Models Hallucinate](https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/)

## Instructions:

1. Go to Settings â†’ Inline Link Preview
2. Toggle "Dynamic preview mode" on
3. View this note in Live Preview mode
4. You should see inline preview bubbles appear after the bare URLs above
5. Toggle it off to see the bare URLs without previews
