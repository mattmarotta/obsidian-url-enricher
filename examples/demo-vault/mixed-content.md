# Mixed Content - Real-World Usage Examples

This page demonstrates how URL Enricher works in realistic note-taking scenarios, with URLs mixed into various types of content.

## Research Note Example

### AI Safety and Alignment

I've been researching AI safety incidents and how major labs handle transparency. Anthropic published a detailed postmortem about recent issues: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/a-postmortem-of-three-recent-issues

This pairs well with OpenAI's research on hallucination mechanics: https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/

**Key takeaways:**
- Transparency builds trust
- Post-incident analysis is valuable for the community
- Both labs are investing heavily in safety research

## Bookmark Collection

### Quick Access Links

> **Note on Tables:** URLs inside markdown tables display as standard Obsidian links (not enriched previews). This is because Obsidian renders tables as HTML widgets in Live Preview mode, and the plugin can only apply decorations to text in the editor layer, not inside rendered widgets. This is the same reason URLs in code blocks aren't enriched.

## Why This Works Well

This page demonstrates URL Enricher's value in real note-taking:

1. **Context Preserved** - Your notes and URLs coexist naturally
2. **Visual Scanning** - Rich previews help you quickly identify links
3. **No Markdown Clutter** - URLs stay clean, no manual formatting needed
4. **Information Dense** - Previews provide context without clicking
5. **Completely Non-Destructive** - Source markdown unchanged

**Switch to card style for a different view:** Change frontmatter to `preview-style: card` and see how the same content looks with more detailed previews.

## Tips for Your Own Notes

**URL Enricher works great for:**
- Research notes with sources
- Recipe collections
- Learning paths and courses
- Product/shopping research
- Meeting notes with references
- Bookmark collections
- Reading lists
- Video playlists

**Frontmatter suggestions:**
- Research notes → `card` style with descriptions
- Quick reference → `inline` style, shorter lengths
- Bookmark pages → `card` style for visual browsing
- Meeting notes → `inline` style for compactness
