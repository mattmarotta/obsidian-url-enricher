**Note:** Compare this page with [inline-previews.md](inline-previews.md) to see the difference between card and inline styles. Both pages contain the same URLs, just with different display modes.

**Tip:** Card style is great for:
- Bookmark collections
- Research notes with important references
- Curated link lists
- When you want maximum visual impact
