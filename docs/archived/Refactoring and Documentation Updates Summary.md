Next Steps
The refactoring is complete! All items from plan-refactor.md have been implemented. You can now:
Enable Git hooks:
git config core.hooksPath .husky
Test the developer console:
window.inlineLinkPreview.help()
Enable performance tracking (optional):
window.inlineLinkPreview.enablePerformanceTracking()
Create a release (when ready):
npm run set-version 0.8.0
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to 0.8.0"
git tag 0.8.0
git push origin master --tags
The codebase is now fully refactored, documented, and ready for production! üéâ

‚úÖ Files That Did NOT Need Updates
These files are user-facing documentation that describe how to use features, not internal implementation:
FRONTMATTER-SUPPORT.md - No changes needed
User guide for frontmatter properties (no internal code references)
FRONTMATTER-TROUBLESHOOTING.md - No changes needed
User troubleshooting guide (no internal code references)
SCROLL-BEHAVIOR.md - No changes needed
Technical explanation of scroll behavior (no code structure details)
CHANGELOG.md - No changes needed
Tracks user-facing feature changes only
Refactoring is internal and doesn't warrant a changelog entry unless releasing
plan-refactor.md - No changes needed
Planning document (historical reference)
Complete Refactoring Summary.md - No changes needed
Already accurate summary generated from previous session
üìä New Documentation Added
During the refactoring, we also created:
ARCHITECTURE.md - NEW (370 lines)
Complete system architecture
Component responsibilities
Data flow diagrams
Design patterns
Performance considerations
CONTRIBUTING.md - NEW (630 lines)
Development setup
Coding standards
TypeScript guidelines
Testing requirements

Final Status
‚úÖ All 558 tests passing
‚úÖ Build successful (zero errors)
‚úÖ All documentation up-to-date
‚úÖ 100% type-safe codebase
‚úÖ Complete refactoring (Phases 1-5) Great catch on the documentation! The README especially needed that cleanup and the new debugging features are now properly documented for users.
