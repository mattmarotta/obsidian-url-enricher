# Release Notes - v0.5.0

## What's New in v0.5.0

This maintenance release fixes critical bugs with description length settings and adds important documentation for cache management. v0.5.0 builds on the v0.4.0 complete rewrite that made the plugin 100% non-destructive.

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed Description Length Settings
**The card and bubble description length settings now work correctly!**

In v0.4.0, we introduced separate settings for card and bubble description lengths, but they didn't work:
- The **bubble length setting did nothing** - it was completely ignored
- The **card length setting** appeared to control both styles
- Root cause: Description truncation happened before the preview style was determined

**What we fixed:**
- Description truncation now happens AFTER preview style determination
- Cards properly use `cardDescriptionLength` (default: 200 characters)
- Bubbles properly use `bubbleDescriptionLength` (default: 100 characters)  
- Each style now works independently as intended

**Impact:** Users can now properly customize description lengths for each preview style!

### Removed Unused Legacy Setting
- Removed the deprecated `maxDescriptionLength` setting that wasn't being used anywhere
- Cleaned up settings interface to reduce confusion
- Proper validation added for both card and bubble length settings

---

## üìö Documentation Improvements

### Cache Clearing Guide (CRITICAL for Testing)
Added comprehensive documentation about cache management:

**The Problem:** The plugin caches metadata and favicons for 30 days for performance. During development/testing, cached data prevents you from seeing changes - making it appear that code fixes aren't working when they actually are!

**The Solution:** New documentation in `AGENTS.md` explains:
- **When to clear cache:** After metadata changes, favicon updates, CSS modifications
- **How to clear cache:** Settings ‚Üí Inline Link Preview ‚Üí Clear cache button
- **Testing workflow:** Step-by-step guide (build ‚Üí reload ‚Üí clear cache ‚Üí test)
- **Agent guidance:** Template for AI assistants to remind users

**Settings UI Updated:**
- Cache clearing button now says: "Use this if you're not seeing updated previews after changes"
- Makes the use case explicit for end users

---

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Settings Architecture
- Settings now properly propagate to metadata handlers via context
- Added `updateSettings()` method to `LinkPreviewService`
- `MetadataHandlerContext` includes settings for handler access
- Proper normalization and validation for both card and bubble lengths

### Code Organization  
- Fixed truncation logic order (style determination ‚Üí truncation)
- Better separation of concerns in decoration flow
- More maintainable and debuggable code

### For Users Upgrading from v0.3.x or Earlier

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

After updating to v0.5.0:

1. **Clear your cache first!** Settings ‚Üí Inline Link Preview ‚Üí Clear cache
2. **Test card lengths:** Change card length setting and verify with a card-style preview
3. **Test bubble lengths:** Change bubble length setting and verify with a bubble-style preview
4. **Verify independence:** Changing one length should not affect the other style

**Important:** Always clear the cache after updating the plugin to see changes properly!
